# future-sales-prediction
In this project, I will develop a model to predict 3 months of item-level sales data at different store locations. 

The raw dataset contains 5 years of store-item sales data of 50 different items at 10 different. An accurate forecast for the next three months would greatly facilitate the management of retail stores.
